We people are working on a common project in a scale region but my servers are in different zones. So I want to share project information with everyone simlutaneously. Configure efs storage should be mount on every server.

step 1: Launch an instance in North Virginia region using aws linux server with http port 80 and nfs port 2049 as security rules.
(Launch instance -> name -> AWS linux -> t2.micro -> keys -> deafault Vpc -> subnet(1a) -> auto assignn enable -> select esg -> add port 8080 ->add nfs port 2049-> launch)

step 2: Launch another instance using redhat server with same security grp.
(Launch instance -> name -> redhat -> t2.micro -> keys -> deafault Vpc -> subnet(1b) -> auto assignn enable -> select esg -> add port 8080 ->add nfs port 2049-> launch)

step 3: Open EFS and create file system

step 4: Now delete the file system for remaining regions except (us-1a,us-1b).Change the security group of the file system in both regions.
(network -> manage -> remove the unused zones -> change the sg for the zones)

step 5: Connect the terminal with the redhat server and install nfs.
Connect the terminal with the aws server.

step 7: Create a directory in both terminal and copy the nfs command from efs.

yum install nfs-utils -y
rpmquery nfs-utils

step 8: Now create 10 files in this terminal.

mkdir /tony
cd /tony
touch tony.txt{1..10}

step 9: Connect the terminal with the linux server, create a directory and copy the nfs command

mkdir /tom

step 10: open the directory to view the files created in redhat server.

cd /tom
ls
